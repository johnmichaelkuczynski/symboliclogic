<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-1-0-0">1.0 The concept of an inference</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">To make an inference is to form a new belief on the basis of an old one. Here</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is an example. My friend Larry has been evicted from his apartment. I let him</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">stay with me until he finds a new place to live. I notice that, shortly after</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Larry moves in, all of my money and valuables start disappearing. I also</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">notice that purchases that I didn’t make are appearing on my credit card bills.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">I know that nobody other than Larry had access to my money, valuables, and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">credit cards. So I infer that Larry has stolen my money and valuables and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">illicitly used my credit cards.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Inferential knowledge is indirect knowledge. Non-inferential knowledge is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">direct knowledge. There is some reason to believe that all knowledge is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">inferential. (This issue is discussed in Section 5.) In any case, it’s clear that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">some knowledge is relatively direct. My knowledge that I am now typing on</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">a keyboard is more direct than my knowledge that heat is molecular motion.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-1-1-0">1.1 Inductive inference vs. deductive inference</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">A premise is a belief that one either has or is willing to accept for</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">argument’s sake. An inference always begins with certain premises and ends</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">with a conclusion that one accepts on the basis of those premises. An</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">inference is legitimate if the premises warrants acceptance of the conclusion.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">There are two very different reasons why acceptance of P might warrant</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">acceptance of Q. On the one hand, it might be impossible, for reasons of a</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">strictly logical nature, that Q should be false if P is true. (P: Smith owns 127</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">cars. Q: Smith owns more than 100 cars.) On the other hand, it might be</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">unlikely, but not impossible, that Q should be false if P is true. (P: Smith</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">owns 127 cars. Q: Smith is very wealthy.)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P entails Q if it is logically impossible that Q should be false if P is true.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P confirms Q if P increases the likelihood that Q is true.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Given only that P confirms Q, it doesn't follow that acceptance of P</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">warrants acceptance of Q. Smith is more likely to find a cure for cancer if he</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is intelligent than if he is unintelligent, and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P: Smith is intelligent</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">therefore confirms</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Q: Smith will find a cure for cancer.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">But acceptance of P obviously doesn't warrant acceptance of Q, since Q is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">more likely than not to be false even if P is true.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">By the same token, P does warrant acceptance of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">R: Smith has not had more than 10 massive strokes,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">given that that, if P is true, there is only a small chance that R is false.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-1-2-0">1.2 Deduction in relation to entailment</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If P entails Q, then Q can be deduced from P. If a given person knows that P</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">entails Q and on that basis infers Q</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P: x is a square.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Q: x has more than two sides.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">It is impossible for Q to be false if P is true. Therefore, P entails Q.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Given only that P entails Q, it doesn’t follow that, if one infers Q from P,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">one is thereby making a legitimate inference.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If Smith knows that P is true and Smith correctly believes that P entails Q,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Smith’s inference does not yield knowledge of Q unless Smith’s reason for</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">believing that P entails Q is the right one. If Smith believes that squares have</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">90 sides and for that reason infers Q from P, Smith has not made a legitimate</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">inference, it being a coincidence that he arrived at the right conclusion.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-1-3-0">1.3 Induction in relation to confirmation</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P confirms Q if the probability of Q, given P, is higher than the probability of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Q, given not-P. Equivalently, P confirms Q if P, if true, raises the probability</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of Q without giving Q a probability of 100%.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">It follows that a sufficient condition for P’s confirming Q is that Q be</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">capable of being legitimately inductively inferred from P:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P: Smith drives a Rolls Royce, wears extremely expensive clothes, has</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">an excellent credit rating, has an excellent employment history, all of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">his jobs being extremely lucrative ones; and, finally, Smith has no</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">criminal record.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Q: Smith is wealthy.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P, if true, makes it sufficiently improbable that Q is false that we may infer</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Q from P. Such an inference is not deductive, given that Smith might be an</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">extraordinarily talented but penniless con-artist.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Even though Q’s being capable of being legitimately inductively inferred</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">from P is sufficient for P’s confirming Q, it is not necessary for it.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P: Smith is the most intellectually gifted person in Russia.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Q: Smith will find a cure for cancer.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P raises the probability of Q, whereas not-P lowers the probability of Q.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Thus, P confirms Q, even though by does not by itself warrant acceptance of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Q.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">True statements can confirm false ones, but they cannot entail them.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Smith’s fingerprints are on the murder weapon, though true, confirms the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">falsehood that Smith is the murderer. But Smith’s fingerprints are on the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">murder weapon does not entail Smith is the murderer.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If P entails Q, Q is a logical consequence of P.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Thus, if P is true, no falsehood is a logical consequence of P.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">At the same time, if Q is true, it is a logical consequence of some</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">falsehood P:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P: Smith’s fingerprints are on every weapon in existence entails the truth</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Q: Smith’s fingerprints are on the murder weapon.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Indeed, given any true proposition Q, there are infinitely many falsehoods</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P such that Q is a logical consequence of P.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P1: Either Smith’s fingerprints are on every weapon in existence or 1+2=1.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P2: Either Smith’s fingerprints are on every weapon in existence or 1+2=1.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P3: Either Smith’s fingerprints are on every weapon in existence or 1+3=1.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Pn: Either Smith’s fingerprints are on every weapon in existence or 1+n=1</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Q is a logical consequence of Pi, for any i≥1.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-1-4-0">1.4 Validity vs. soundness</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">A valid argument is a deductive argument whose premises, if true, in fact</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">give a probability of 100% to the conclusion. In other words, a valid</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">argument is an argument whose premises are supposed to give 100%</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">probability to the conclusion and whose premises in fact give 100%</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">probability to the conclusion.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">A valid argument can have false premises. For an argument to be valid it is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">necessary only that if the premises were true, then there would be a 100%</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">chance that the conclusion is true. It may be that Smith doesn’t drive a Rolls</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Royce or any kind of car for that matter. But it’s still the case that if Smith</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">did drive a Rolls Royce, then, given that all Rolls Royces are cars, there</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">would be no chance that Smith didn’t drive a car.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">A sound argument is a valid argument with true premises. (For example:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">JMK is a human; all humans are mammals; therefore, JMK is a mammal.)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">A valid argument cannot possibly have true premises and a false</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">conclusion, but it can have false premises and a false conclusion or false</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">premises and a true conclusion.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-1-5-0">1.5 Two kinds of induction</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">There are two kinds of inductive inference: induction by enumeration and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">inference to the best explanation.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If, on the basis of the fact that you know of many x’s that are y’s and of no</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">x’s that aren’t y’s, you infer that all x’s are y’s or that the next x you</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">encounter is a y, you’ve performed a case of induction by enumeration.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Here is an example. You’ve seen a million swans. They were all white.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(Moreover, you knew in each case that what you were seeing was a white</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">swan—you didn’t think it was, for example, a beige duck.) You’ve never</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">seen, or otherwise come to know of, any non-white swan. On this basis, you</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">infer that all swans are white and, therefore, that, if you ever encounter</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">another swan, it will be white.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If, in order to account for something of which you have knowledge, you</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">posit the existence of something of which you don’t have knowledge; you</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">have made an inference to the best explanation.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">All theories are cases of inference to the best explanation. All the theories</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">put forth by Einstein, Darwin, Freud are instances of this mode of inference.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Inference to the best explanation is a very powerful form of inference. (In</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">fact, we will see in Section 1.7. that it is the only form of non-deductive</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">inference. So-called “induction by enumeration,” to the extent that it isn’t a</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">spurious method of inference, collapses into inference to the best</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">explanation.)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The conclusions of inferences to the best explanation are always causal</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">statements. You posit the existence of X, which you don’t know of, in order</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">to explain Y, which you do know of, because, in your judgment, X, if it</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">existed, would cause Y to occur.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Example #3 is a case of inference to the best explanation. I infer that Larry</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">stole my credit cards (etc.) because the relevant data is easy to explain on the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">assumption that he did, the reason being that his doing so would have</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">generated that data, and hard to explain on the assumption that he didn’t, the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">reason being that it’s unclear what else could have generated that data.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">To take another example: if you infer that a mouse has been eating the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">cheese in your cupboard, it’s because a mouse’s doing so would have</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">generated the relevant data (e.g., the tiny little footprints inside the cupboard),</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">and it’s not clear what else could have generated that data.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">In some cases, the conclusions of inferences to the best explanation aren’t</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">themselves causal statements. Our knowledge that water consists of H2O</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">molecules isn’t itself a causal statement. Cause-effect relations hold between</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">distinct entities (e.g., thunder and lightning). Water and H2O aren’t distinct.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">That said, it is believed that water consists of H2O molecules only because</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">its being so composed would cause various things to happen that do in fact</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">happen. So even though the conclusion of an inference to the best explanation</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">need not itself be a causal statement, all inferences to the best explanation are</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">causal inferences.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-1-6-0">1.6 A fact about induction by enumeration</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Induction by enumeration isn’t nearly as powerful a form of inference as</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">inference to the best explanation. Given only that every single one of the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">5,000 first editions you’ve ever come across smelled like pipe tobacco, you</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">cannot reasonably infer that all first editions smell like pipe tobacco. What if</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">all of those first editions were the property of your pipe-smoking friend</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Larry? In that case, you’d have good to reason to suspect that their smelling</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">like pipe tobacco had to do, not with their being first editions, but with their</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">being things that had been around Larry.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">By the same token, so far as you are entitled to infer that all first editions</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">smell like pipe tobacco, it’s only to the extent that you have reason to believe</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">that a thing’s smelling like pipe tobacco is rooted in its being a first edition.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">But that means that, if the data entitles you to infer that all first editions smell</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">like pipe tobacco, it’s only because it also entitles you to accept some</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">inference to the best explanation (one to the effect that a thing’s being a first</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">edition is, for some reason or other, responsible for its smelling like pipe</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">tobacco).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">In general, induction by enumeration is parasitic on inference to the best</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">explanation. In Chapter 12 of Analytic Philosophy, it is shown how a failure</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">to see this underlies the spurious belief that there is no non-deductive,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">inferential knowledge.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-1-7-0">1.7 Two kinds of entailment</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Just as there are two kinds of inductive inference, so there are two kinds of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">deductive inference. In other words, there are two kinds of entailment: formal</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">entailment and informal entailment.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">An entailment is “informal” if the syntactic structures of the sentences</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">involved are not what make the entailment go through. Consider the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">following entailment:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph"># If Smith is tall and Jones snores, then Smith is tall.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">This sentence has the form:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If P and Q, then P.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If a sentence has that form, it constitutes a valid inference. So # is made true</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">by its form—that is, by its syntax.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">But not all valid entailments hold in virtue of syntax. In fact, most do not.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Consider the sentence:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">^ If Smith weighs 1000 pounds, and Jones weighs 80 pounds, then</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Smith weighs more than Jones.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Obviously ^ is valid. But its syntax isn’t what makes it true, since that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">sentence has the same syntax as:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">^^ If Smith weighs 80 pounds, and Jones weighs 1000 pounds,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">then Smith weighs more than Jones,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">which is obviously invalid.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-2-0-0">2.0 Some notational conventions relevant to formal logic</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Statements of the form “if P, then Q” are known as “conditionals.” The</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">expression “→” stands for “if...then.” So “P→Q” means “if P, then Q.” Thus,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(1) Smith has four cars→Smith has more than one car</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">means that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(2) If Smith has four cars, then Smith has more than one car.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Thus, “P→Q” can be taken to mean that P implies Q. Thus “→” expresses</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">implication.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">As we will use the expression “→,” the expression “P→Q” means that P</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">entails Q, i.e., that it is impossible for P to be true if Q is false. In other</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">words, “→” expresses what is sometimes referred to as strict entailment. (P</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">strictly entails Q if, supposing that P is true, there is no way that Q can be</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">false. In this work, “entailment” and “strict entailment” are synonymous</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">expressions.)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">This isn’t how “→” is typically used. It is typically used to express a much</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">weaker notion known as material implication. This term is defined below.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Biconditionals and “↔”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Statements of the form “if P then Q, and if Q then P” are known as</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“biconditionals.” When stated in non-artificial notation, “if P then Q, and if Q</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">then P” is typically compressed into “P iff Q” (or “P just in case Q” or “P</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">exactly if Q”). We’ll compress it into: “P↔Q.” So “Smith is a father↔Smith</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is a male parent” says the same thing as “Smith is a father iff Smith is a male</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">parent.”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Parentheses as indicators of scope</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Parentheses are used to indicate how sentences are to be grouped together.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Consider the sentence:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(3) “snow is white and grass is green→grass is green.”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(3) is ambiguous between:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(4) it’s the case that snow is white; and it’s also the case that, if grass is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">green, then grass is green</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(5) supposing that it’s the case that snow is white and that grass is green,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">it follows that grass is green.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(4) and (5) have different meanings. (5) doesn’t say that snow is white. Nor</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">does it say that grass is green. It says that if it’s the case that both grass is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">green and snow is white, then it’s also the case that grass is green. (4), on the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">other hand, says (among other things) that snow is white. So (4) is false in</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">universes where snow is green. But (5) is true in such universes. (In fact, (5)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is true in every possible universe.) Since there are circumstances where (4) is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">false but (5) is true, they don’t have the same meanings.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Modern symbolic logic gives us a way of avoiding the laborious ad hoc</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">methods just used to disambiguate (3). To express (4), we say:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(3.4) snow is white and (grass is green→grass is green).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">And to express (5), we say:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(3.5) (snow is white and grass is green)→grass is green.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">In general, any two co-parenthetical sentences are more tightly bonded to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">each other than either is to anything that isn’t co-parenthetical with those</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">sentences.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Negation</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">~P is the negation of P. Thus,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“~(snow is not white)”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is the negation of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“snow is white.”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">This means that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“~(snow is not white)”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is meaning-equivalent with</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“it is not the case that snow is white.”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Be it noted that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“~(snow is not white)”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">does not say that snow is black. Nor does it say that snow is green. It says</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">only that snow isn’t white; everything else is left open.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">In general, the negation of a sentence isn’t the same thing as the “opposite”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of that sentence. In modern logic, the word “opposite” has no meaning. The</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">use of the “~” makes it easy to negate statements that would otherwise be</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">hard to negate without prejudging important issues or using cumbersome</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">constructions. Consider the sentence:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(%) If John likes to listen to Mozart, then Larry likes</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">to listen to Brahms or the sky is blue.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">In natural language one way to negate (%) is to put the expression “it is not</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">the case that’’ in front of it. The result of this operation is:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(%1) “it is not the case that if John likes to listen to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Mozart, then Larry likes to listen to Brahms or the sky</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is blue.”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">But there’s a problem. (%1) is ambiguous, as it could mean either:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(%2) either the sky is blue or it is not the case Larry likes to listen to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Brahms if John likes to listen to Mozart</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">or</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(%3) it isn’t the case that the sky is blue; nor is it the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">case that Larry likes to listen to Brahms if John likes to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">listen to Mozart.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">It takes work to come up with each of these two sentences. Each of the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">original two sentences had to be reparsed; and in each case this reparsing</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">involved the use of methods that, being ad hoc, could be arrived at only</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">through a creative insight and logical inference. Such Herculean measures</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">shouldn’t have been necessary, given that the objective was only to perform a</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">purely grammatical operation.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">This problem doesn’t arise in our special symbolic notation. % can be</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">unambiguously disambiguated in a mechanical, thought-free manner. One</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">need only put a ‘~’ before % and then enclose the part one wants negated in</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">parentheses. Thus, the symbolic analogue of:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(%2S) ~(Larry likes to listen to Brahms if John likes to listen to Mozart) or</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">the sky is blue;</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">and the symbolic analogue of (%3) is:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(%3S) ~(either the sky is blue or (Larry likes to listen to Brahms if John</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">likes to listen to Mozart)).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">In (%3S), the scope of the negation-sign is % in its entirety. (Were it not for</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">the parentheses immediately flanking its second disjunct, (%3S) would be</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">ambiguous between a conditional whose consequent was a disjunction and a</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">disjunction one of whose disjuncts was a conditional.) In (%2S), the scope of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">the negation-sign is confined to the sentence “if John likes to listen to Mozart,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">then Larry likes to listen to Brahms.”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Thus, in our symbolic notation, parentheses are used is to make it clear</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">how much scope is to be given to a given operator. An “operator” is an</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">expression that, given one or more sentences, yields a new sentence.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Examples of operators are: “it is not the case that,” “or,” “and,” “because,” “it</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is possible that,” and “Fred believes that.”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“Fred believes that” is an operator because, when given the sentence</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“snow is white,” it yields a new sentence, namely: “Fred believes that snow is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">white.” “And” is an operator because, when given the sentences “snow is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">white” and “grass is green,” it yields the sentence “snow is white and grass is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">green.” “Because” is an operator for the same reason mutatis mutandis.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(Since “snow is white because grass is green” has a very different meaning</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">from “grass is green because snow is white,” “because” operates on ordered</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">pairs of sentences.)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">When an operator O occurs in some sentence S, where S has one or more</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">sentences as proper parts, the scope of that occurrence is identical with the set</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of sentences thereby combined into a single sentence.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Consider the sentence:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(i) “Jim is tired because he went jogging and his wife Sally is a very</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">demanding person.”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">This is ambiguous. It could mean either:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(ii) Jim’s wife Sally is a very demanding person; moreover, Jim is tired</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">because he went jogging</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">or</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(iii) There are two reasons why Jim is tired: first he went jogging; second,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Jim’s wife Sally is a very demanding person.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Thus, in English (or any other natural language), use of the expression</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“because” may yield a sentence that is ambiguous and, in addition, can be</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">disambiguated only by successfully doing a certain amount of syntax-</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">chopping and, therefore, logic-chopping.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">But in our symbolic notation, one can disambiguate (i) without having to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">do any logic-chopping. One need only put parentheses around the two</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">sentences that one wants joined by the “because.” Thus, the symbolic</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">analogue of (ii) is:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(iiS) (Jim is tired because he went jogging) and Sally is a very demanding</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">person.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">And the symbolic analogue of (iii) is:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(iiiS) Jim is tired because (he went jogging and Sally is a very demanding</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">person).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Negation in relation to the use of parentheses</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Parentheses make it clear what is being negated. For example,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(A) ~snow is white or grass is green</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is ambiguous. It could mean either</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(B) Either it’s the case that grass is green or it’s the case that snow isn’t</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">white</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">or</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(C) it isn’t the case that (snow is white or grass is green).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(C) is equivalent with:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(D) snow isn’t white and grass isn’t green.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(B) isn’t equivalent with (D), since (B), unlike (D), is true in a world where</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">grass is green.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(A1) ~(snow is white or grass is green)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">says the same thing as (C), and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(A2) ~(snow is white) or grass is green</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">says the same thing as (B).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Thus, parentheses make it clear how much scope a given occurrence of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“~” has—that is, they make it clear how much it is negating.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The modal operators—the box and the pound sign</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“□P” means “necessarily P” and “#P” means “possibly P.”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Typically, the possibility-operator is a diamond, not a pound sign, but this</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">publication software doesn’t support use of the diamond.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Note concerning the modal operators: The box and the pound sign are to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">be given minimal scope. So “□P→Q” is not to mean that it’s necessarily the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">case that P implies Q. Rather, it is to mean that, if it’s necessarily true that P</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is the case, then it follows that Q is the case. “□(P→Q),” on the other hand,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">does say that it’s necessarily the case that P implies Q.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The non-exclusive meaning of “or”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">We’ll use “or” in the non-exclusive sense. So, as we’ll be using it “either</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Smith is having dinner or Smith is in London” is consistent with Smith’s</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">being in London while having dinner. In order for “P or Q” to be true, all that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is necessary is one of those two statements be true. So there are three</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">circumstances under which “P or Q” is true:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(i) P is true and Q is false.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(ii) Q is true and P is false.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(iii) P is true and Q is true.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">In contemporary logic, both formal and informal, “or”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is always used in the non-exclusive sense.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“Unless”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(a) We work unless it is raining</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is equivalent with</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(b) If we aren’t working, it’s raining.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">In general,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(A) P unless Q</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">means</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(B) ~P→Q</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The Sheffer Stroke</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“/” is  a logical operator known as the “Sheffer Stroke.” The Sheffer Stroke</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is defined thus:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P/Q≡DF~P and ~Q</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Hence the following theorems:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">~P↔P/P</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P↔(P/P)/(P/P)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(P and Q) ↔(P/P)/(Q/Q)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(P or Q)↔(P/Q)/(P/Q)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Compatibility and incompatibility</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Statements are compatible when neither entails the negation of the other.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Statements are incompatible when the one entails the negation of the other. P</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">entails Q just in case P is incompatible with ~Q.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-2-1-0">2.1 Some general principles relevant to formal logic</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Deduction is truth-preserving: A true statement cannot entail a false one. In</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">other words, a false statement cannot be validly inferred from a true one.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Deduction is transitive (a corollary of the fact that it’s truth-preserving): R</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is a transitive relation if, supposing that x bears to R to y and y bears R to z,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">then x bears R to z. The relation of being less tall than is transitive. So is the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">relation of logical-consequence. Therefore, deduction is transitive. A</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">statement entails anything entailed by any one of its consequences. For</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">example:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If Smith is an elephant, then Smith is a mammal.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If Smith is a mammal, then Smith has hair.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Therefore, if Smith is an elephant, then Smith has hair.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Induction isn’t truth-preserving: A true statement may confirm a false one.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">For practically any value of “x”, the statement</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P: x is a heavy smoker</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">certainly confirms</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Q: x won’t live to be a hundred.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">But for some values of x, P is true and Q is false, as there have been heavy</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">smokers who lived to be a 100.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Commentary: This principle is a simple of corollary of the fact that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">multiplying n by a proper fraction yields a number m<n. The same is true of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">the next principle.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Induction isn’t transitive: A corollary of the non-truth-preserving character</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of induction is that induction is not transitive. In other words, given only that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P confirms Q and that Q confirms R, it doesn’t follow that P confirms R:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P: Smith is a morbidly obese man with a heart condition and terminal</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">cancer who is due to be executed in five hours.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Q: Smith is a morbidly obese man with a heart condition and terminal</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">cancer who is going to die soon.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">R: Smith will soon die of some ailment related to his obesity, his heart-</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">condition, or his cancer.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P confirms Q; Q confirms R. But P doesn’t confirm R. P makes it a veritable</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">certainty that Smith will be executed in five hours and, therefore, that he</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">won’t die for reasons having to do with his heart or weight or cancer-</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">situation. So P disconfirms R, even though it confirms Q, which, unlike P,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">does confirm R.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Contraposition, conversion, inversion</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">These are operations that are performed on conditional statements (statements</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of the form “if P, then Q”).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The contrapositive of (P→Q) is (~Q→~P).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Thus, the contrapositive of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“If Bob is a dog, then Bob is a mammal”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“If Bob is not a mammal, then Bob is not a dog.”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Statements are equivalent with their contrapositives. In other words,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(P→Q)↔(~Q→~P). Bob’s being a dog entails his being a mammal iff his</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">being a non-mammal entails his being a non-dog.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The converse of (P→Q) is (Q→P). Thus, the converse of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“If Bob is a human, then Bob is a mammal”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“If Bob is a mammal, then Bob is human.”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">As this example shows, statements are not generally equivalent with their</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">converses. It’s only when both antecedent and consequent are equivalent that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">a given conditional is equivalent with its converse. (In (P→Q), P is the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">antecedent and Q is the consequent.) Thus, the converse of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“If Bob is a father then Bob is a male parent is true”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is true, since antecedent and consequence are equivalent.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The inverse of (P→Q) is (not-P→not-Q). Thus, the inverse of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“If Bob is a human, then Bob is a mammal”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“if Bob is not a human, then Bob is not a mammal.”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">As this example shows, statements are not generally equivalent with their</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">inverses. It’s only when both antecedent and consequent are equivalent that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">conditional is equivalent with its inverse. This is because the converse of a</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">proposition is equivalent with its inverse. In other words,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(Q→P)↔(not-P→not-Q).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The reason why they’re equivalent is that the second is the contrapositive</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of the first. (As we know, contraposing a conditional produces an equivalent</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">conditional.)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">A sentence-level operation is truth-preserving if, when given a true</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">sentence as input, it cannot possibly yield a false sentence as output.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Contraposition is truth-preserving. Conversion and inversion are not.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Exercise: Prove that, given any conditional sentence S, the contrapositive</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of S is equivalent with S. Further, prove that it is not the case that, given any</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">conditional sentence S, the converse of S is equivalent with S. Finally, prove</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">that, given any conditional sentence S, the inverse of S is equivalent with the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">converse of S.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Material vs. strict vs. formal entailment</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Logicians distinguish between “formal” and “material” implication, and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">they distinguish each from “strict” implication. “Strict implication” is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">synonymous with “entailment”, and “strict entailment” is therefore a</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">pleonasm.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P formally entails Q if the sentence ‹if P, then Q› is an instance of an open-</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">sentence that is true for all values of its free variables. Thus, a formal truth is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">a truth that is an instance of an open-sentence that is true for all values of its</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">free variables. “2 = 2” is a ‘formal’ truth, because it is an instance of the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">open-sentence, namely:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“x = x”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">which is true for all values of its variables.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Formal implication is a kind of strict implication. Any case of formal</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">implication is a case of strict implication, but not vice versa. The reasons for</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">this are given in Analytic Philosophy, Chapters 1, 6, and 18, and also in</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Section 4.5 of the present work.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“P materially implies Q” is true if any one of the following three</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">conditions is met:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(i) P is false and Q is false;</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(ii) P is false and Q is true;</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(iii) P is true and Q is true.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">It is only if</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(iv) P is true and Q is false</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">that P does not materially imply Q.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If P is any false statement P, and Q is any statement at all, “P is true and Q</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is false” is false. For this reason, any false statement materially implies all</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">statements.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Material implication isn’t a form of implication at all. So, while it’s a fact</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">that, for any statement Q, any given falsity “materially implies” Q, that fact is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">an innocuous consequence of a linguistic convention that, although it</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">concerns the word “implication,” has nothing to do with implication at all.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Material and strict entailment may hold between propositions or between</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">expressions. But formal entailment holds only among expressions. It is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">typically held to hold among sentence-types. My strongly held view is that it</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">holds only among sentence-tokens. (See Chapter 4 of Analytic Philosophy for</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">a defense of this claim.) This is the view of Peter Strawson, Jon Barwise, and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">John Perry. But for the sake of brevity we will use the term ‘sentence’ to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">stand for sentence-type and sentence-tokens.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Modality</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“Modal” means “having to do with necessity or possibility.” Possibility and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">necessity are properties of statements, not objects. Any statement of the form</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">□P (‘it’s necessarily the case that P’) or # P (‘it is possible that P’) is a modal</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">statement.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“Necessary” and “possible” are interdefinable. “Necessary” can be defined</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">as “not possibly not,” and “possibly” can be defined as “not necessarily not.”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Thus,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">□P iff ~#~Q.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Statements that affirm bearing relations, whether deductive or inductive,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">are modal. Thus, causal statements are modal statements, since they have the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">form □(if P, then Q).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Causal necessity isn’t logical necessity, of course. Given that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(i) I threw gasoline on the fire,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">it is causally necessary that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(ii) The fire flared up.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">But (ii) isn’t a logical consequence of (i). In other words, it can’t be known</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">through meaning-analysis or syntax-chopping that (ii) cannot be false if (i) is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">true.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-2-3-0">2.3 Principles and theorems of formal logic</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">1. For any x and any y, ((x = y)→(for any property F, (x has F↔y has F))).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(Leibniz’s Law.)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Given anything x and anything y, if x is the very same thing as y, then x has a</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">given property just in case y has that property.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If x is the very same thing as y, then anything true of the one is true of the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">other.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Anything true of one thing is true of another whenever those things are one</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">and the same.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">A necessary condition for identity is sameness of properties.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Commentary: In Chapter 16 of Analytic Philosophy, it is argued that,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">although this principle is clearly true for “synchronic” identity-clams, it is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">clearly false for “diachronic” identity claims.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">2. For any x and any y, (given any property F, ((x has F↔y has F)→(x = y)))</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(The identity of indiscernibles.)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Given anything x and anything y, if it the case that x has a given property just</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">in case y has that property, then it follows that x is the very same thing as x.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If x has no properties that y lacks and y has no properties that x lacks, then x</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is the very same thing as y.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">A sufficient condition for identity is sameness of properties.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Commentary: Though it has been questioned, this principle is clearly correct.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Given any object x, x has the property of being identical with x. So, given</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">any object y, if y has every property that x has, then y has the property of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">being identical with x and is therefore itself identical with x.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">But, while it’s true that anything having that property is identical with x,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">it’s also trivial. And my suspicion is that those who claim to be asking</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">whether the identity of indiscernibles is correct are really asking a distinct but</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">related question, namely: given an object y that has every property had by x,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">setting aside those properties that are trivially had by anything identical with</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">x (e.g., the property of being identical with x), is y identical with x?</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">That question, unlike the question of whether the identity of indiscernibles</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is correct, isn’t trivial. That said, the answer to it does seem, quite clearly, to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">be “yes.” If, at any given moment, x is in the same place as y, has the same</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">mass, is subjected to the same forces, and so on, then surely x is identical</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">with y.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Additional commentary: The identity of indiscernibles is often said to be the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“converse” of Leibniz’s Law.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">This isn’t correct. For P to be the converse of Q, it is necessary that P be a</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">conditional statement and that Q also be a conditional statement. Leibniz’s</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Law isn’t expressed by a conditional statement, and neither is the identity of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">indiscernibles.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Each is expressed by a universal generalization. In each case, that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">universal generalization is to the effect that each member of an infinitely</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">large class of conditional statements is correct. But neither is itself expressed</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">by a conditional statement, and neither is itself a conditional proposition.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Leibniz’s Law is to the effect that:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(LL) for any x and any y, if x is identical with y, it’s impossible for x to lack</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">any property had by y or vice versa.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">LL is not itself a conditional statement. For the same reason mutatis</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">mutandis, the identity of indiscernibles isn’t given by a conditional statement.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Therefore, neither principle is the converse of the other.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">3. P or ~P. (The law of excluded middle.)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Any given statement is either true or false.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">What isn’t true or false is not a statement.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">S is a statement only if S is either true or false.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">S’s being a statement is sufficient for S’s being either true or false.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">S’s being either true or false is necessary for S’s being a statement.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Commentary: Whether or not 3 is correct depends on what the word</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“statement” is taken to mean. If it’s taken to mean the same thing as</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“sentence,” then 3 is false. The sentence (in other words, the sentence-type)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“I am tired” is neither true nor false. (Certain utterances of it are true and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">certain utterances of it are false.)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If the word “statement” is taken to mean the same thing as “sentence-</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">utterance” (or, more generally, “sentence-token”), then, once again, 3 is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">false. If, while pointing to an empty space, I say “that elephant is in terrible</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">pain,” what I’ve said is neither true nor false. There is no such elephant.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Therefore, there is no elephant x such that I am saying that x in terrible pain.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If I am saying anything at all, there is some elephant x such that what I am</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">saying is true iff x is in terrible pain. Since there is no such elephant, I’m not</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">saying anything; my utterance is neither true nor false.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If the word “statement” is taken to mean the same thing as “proposition,”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">then 3 is correct. What we are seeing is that the so-called truths of symbolic</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">logic—the “laws of logic”—aren’t true at all. They’re statement-forms, not</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">statements, and therefore aren’t true or false. And it isn’t easy to find</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">interpretations of those statement-forms that validate them. In other words, it</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">isn’t easy to figure out what sorts of constants must replace the variables</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">occurring in these “laws” if true sentences are to result. This suggests that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">modern symbolic logic (a.k.a. mathematical logic, a.k.a. formal logic) isn’t</p>

<p class="document-paragraph">(2) All dogs are mammals.</p>

<p class="document-paragraph">SD# is not an instance of modus ponens. To be an instance of modus ponens,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">an argument must have the form:</p>

<p class="document-paragraph">(2*) If P, then Q</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Conclusion: (3*) Q.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Let’s refer to this argument form as “AF*.”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If we replace the occurrence of “P” in AF* with “Smith is a dog” and we</p>

<p class="document-paragraph">AF are replaced with those sentences, the result is SD#. Therefore, SD# is not</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">an instance of modus ponens.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">SD# is a valid argument. But it isn’t an instance of modus ponens. It’s an</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">instance of the following argument form:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(1#) A has property P.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(2#) For any x, if x has P, then x has Q.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Conclusion: (3#) A has Q.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Let’s refer to this argument form as “AF#.”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">SD# makes a statement about SD. SD# says that SD is an instance of</p>

<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-3-0-0">3.0 Some meta-logical principles: Model theoretic entailment</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P model-theoretically entails Q just in case there is no coherently conceivable</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">scenario where P is true and Q is false.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Thus, 1 + 1 = 2 model-theoretically entails triangles have three sides,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">even though the two propositions do not, apart from that, have anything to do</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">with each other.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">This last point is important. There isn’t anything about shapes, let alone</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">triangles specifically, in 1 + 1 = 2; and there isn’t anything about addition in</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">triangles have three sides. So even though, technically, each entails the other,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">there is no significant sense in which the one can be inferred from the other</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">—no sense in which a knowledge of the one yields a knowledge of the other.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Of course, somebody who knows that 1 + 1 = 2 will probably also know</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">that triangles have three sides, but he won’t know the one on the basis of the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">other. By contrast, somebody who knows that x is a case of true belief could</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">potentially know that on the basis of the fact that x is knowledge.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Commentary: Model-theoretic entailment is an over-valued notion that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">doesn’t correspond at all well to the conception of entailment embodied in</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">our inferential practices. Nonetheless, because, in the early ‘60’s, some</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">branches of philosophy were (wrongly) thought to be successfully assimilated</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">to a branch of mathematics known as “model theory”—the purpose of this</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">branch being to study model-theoretic entailment—philosophers now tend to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">treat model-theoretic entailment as the fundamental kind of entailment.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Model-theoretic entailment isn’t really a kind of entailment. It is a theory</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of entailment. Like other scientists, logicians model data. Where logic is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">concerned, the data in question are intuitions on our part to the effect that one</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">statement is a consequence of another.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(K1) “x is knowledge”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">entails</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(K2) “x is a true belief.”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Logicians want to make it clear what it is that we know in knowing this; they</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">want to make it clear what it is for the one statement to entail the second.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Here is the proposal that they came up with:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(MT) for P to entail Q is for there to be no possible circumstance in which</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">the first is true and the second is false.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Why did logicians choose MT when trying to model our intuitions</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">concerning entailment? Because MT is extensionally correct. In other words,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">for any statements P and Q, P entails Q iff there is no possible circumstance</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">where P is true and Q is false.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">But even though there are no counter-examples to it, MT is false. It is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">obviously in virtue of facts about the structures of K1 and K2 that the former</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">entails the latter. The fact that there are no models in which K1 is true and K2</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is false is a mere consequence of that structural fact.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">There is a related point. MT defines entailment in terms of “possible.” This</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">makes it viciously circular. P and Q are compossible (in other words, both P</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">and Q is possible) iff neither entails the negation of the other. We understand</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">the concept of possibility only to the extent that we can understand it in terms</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of entailment (and other bearing-relations). So unless we’re willing to take</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">the radically implausible view that “possible” is a primitive expression, MT</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">defines “entailment” in terms of itself. (A primitive expression is one that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">doesn’t consist of other expressions. Examples of such expressions are “red”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">or “sweet.”)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">To make MT non-circular, we must rid it of the word “possible.” Thus</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">modified, MT is:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(MT*) for P to “entail” Q is for there to be no circumstance in which the first</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is true and the second is false.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">In MT*, ‘circumstance’ must be mean actual circumstance. If it means</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">anything else, MT* will be circular, like MT.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">MT* is false. There is no circumstance in which the moon is made of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">cheese. And there is no circumstance in which I have ten cars. So there is no</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">circumstance in which “the moon is made of cheese” is true and in which</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“JMK has ten cars” is false. So, according to MT*, the former entails the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">latter. But the former doesn’t entail the latter. (The former “materially</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">implies” the latter. But that’s irrelevant, since material implication isn’t</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">entailment.)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">So model-theoretic entailment isn’t entailment at all. It’s what a wrong</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">theory of entailment says that it is.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Some of the principles stated in Section 2.3, not all of them, go through</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">only if “entails” (i.e. “→”) is taken to refer to model-theoretic entailment.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-3-1-0">3.1 Formal entailment</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">In some cases, one statement’s following from another can be determined</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">entirely on the basis of the structures of those sentences. For any statements P</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">and Q, ‹P and Q› entails ‹P.› For any statement P, ‹not not P› entails ‹P›. In</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">other words, “if not-not-P, then P” is true.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If it can be determined that Q follows from P entirely on the basis of the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">structural properties of those sentences, P formally entails Q.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">For a while, it was thought that all entailments could be formalized—that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is, that whenever one statement entails another, it is entirely because of the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">syntactic or structural properties of those sentences. That viewpoint is simply</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">false. Why it is false is explained in Chapter 1 of Analytic Philosophy,</p>

<p class="document-paragraph">But the entailment relation that holds between P1 and Q1 is not just an</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">instance of model-theoretic entailment; it is also an instance of another, more</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">significant kind of entailment. This is made clear by the fact that there is a</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">marked difference between, on the one hand, the relation that holds between</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P1 and Q1 and, on the other hand, the relation that holds between:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P2: 1 + 1 = 2</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Q2: triangles have three sides.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The difference is clear. Given the information contained in P1, it can be</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">deduced that Q1 is true. Q1 is, in some important sense, “implicit in” or</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“contained in” P1. But Q2 isn’t implicit in P2. There isn’t anything concerning</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">triangles in P2—not implicitly or explicitly.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">When we make inferences, they are not of the strictly model-theoretic</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">kind. Rather, they are of the kind where the statement that is inferred is, in</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">some way or other, contained in the statement from which the inference is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">made. So the inference from:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P1: John knows that 1 + 1 = 2</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Q1: John believes that 1 + 1 = 2</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is an instance of the conception of entailment that is embodied in our actual</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">inferential practices. But that inference isn’t formal; it isn’t like the inference</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">from snow is white and grass is green to snow is white: the formal properties</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of P1 and Q1 leave it open whether Q1 follows from P1. This is because those</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">sentences are formally identical with, respectively,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P3: John is sure that 1 + 1 = 2</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Q3: John doubts that 1 + 1 = 2.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P1 is syntactically just like P3, and Q1 is syntactically just like Q3. But there is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">no legitimate inference from P3 to Q3; and since those sentences are</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">syntactically just like P1 and Q1, respectively, it follows there is no legitimate,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">purely syntactic inference from P1 to Q1.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Although, as previously discussed, P1 model-theoretically entails Q1, P1</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">also entails Q1 in some other, much more robust sense. In Kuczynski (2007),</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">I put forth a theory as to the nature of this other, more important sort of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">entailment.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-3-5-0">3.5 The ampliative character of deduction</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">It is often said that, if P entails Q, there is nothing in Q that is not also in P.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">So deduction (i.e., the identifying of entailments) is, according to this, “non-</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">ampliative”—the consequent doesn’t “amplify” the antecedent (i.e., it doesn’t</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">say anything not said by the antecedent).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">This position is obviously false where model-theoretic entailment is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">concerned. (Triangles are shapes model-theoretically entails Socrates is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">identical with Socrates, but there is nothing in the content of the first that has</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">anything to do with Socrates.) And it’s obviously false where formal</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">entailment is concerned. (“Smith is tall” formally entails “either Smith is tall</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">or grass is green,” but there is nothing about grass in “Smith is tall.”)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-3-6-0">3.6 The most important kind of entailment: the non-formal, non-model</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">theoretic kind</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The statement</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(P) 1+1=2</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">model-theoretically entails</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(Q) the interior angles of a Euclidean triangle add up to 180°.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">And Q model-theoretically entails P.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">This is all very well. But it’s patently obvious that you can’t infer the truth</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of P from that of Q, or vice versa. In general, model-theoretical entailment is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">inferentially useless. A precondition for knowing that P entails Q is that you</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">know, first, that P cannot be false and, second that Q cannot be false. But if</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">you know this, there’s no need to infer the one from the other. What this</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">shows is that knowledge of model-theoretic entailments are parasitic on some</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">other, much more fundamental sort of entailment. And what this shows is that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">knowledge of model-theoretic entailments have no significant role in the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">thought-processes of any possible cogitator.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Unlike model theoretic entailment, formal entailment isn’t inferentially</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">useless. But our ability to make formal inferences is parasitic on our ability to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">make informal inferences. Actually, so-called “formal” inferences are</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">informal ones.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Formal entailment is a relation that holds between expressions (more</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">specifically, sentences or sentence-tokens). This means that we have to know</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">what sentences mean to make inferences that are licensed by formal</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">entailments. To infer</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(S1) “snow is white”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">from</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(S2) “snow is white and grass is green,”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">I have to know what those two sentences mean, at least up to a point. I have</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">to know that “and” doesn’t mean what is in fact meant by “or.” I also have to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">know that “snow is white” and “grass is green” are complete sentences—that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">they aren’t drivel, like “bunga berka der.”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">So in order to infer S1 from S2, I have to know the truth</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of some proposition of the form:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(S3) given that S2 means such and such and that S1 means thus and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">such, it follows that S1 is true, given that S2 is true.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">But S3 is not formally true. First of all, it’s a proposition, not a sentence. But</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">even the corresponding sentence (the result of putting the verbiage in</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">question in quotation marks) isn’t formally true. It’s an analytic, logical,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">informal truth.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Second reason: Formal truths, and thus formally true entailments, are</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">instances of universal generalizations that, although analytically true, are not</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">themselves formal truths. The sentence:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(S4) “if snow is white and grass is green, then snow is white”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is formally true. But why? Because</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(S5) for all sentences P and Q, ‹(P and (P→Q))→P›,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">though true, isn’t formally true. It instances (e.g., “if snow is white and grass</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is green, then snow is white”), but not it itself. This is because it has the same</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">form as:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(S6) For no sentences P and Q, ‹(P and (P→Q))→P›,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">which is false.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Some logicians say that, because S5 has an “all” in the place where S6 has a</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“no,” they don’t have the same form. But that’s just a way of saying that they</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">don’t have the same form because, if they did, then S5 wouldn’t be a formal</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">truth anymore. It’s a fact that, in any sense of the expression “same form”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">that isn’t circularly constructed to validate preexisting theories, S5 and S6</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">have the same form. They certainly have the same syntactic form, at least as</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">linguists use the word “syntax.” The rules of sentence construction involved</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">in the one case precisely parallel those used in the other. It’s a simple fact,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">then, that S5 and S6 do not, in any significant sense, differ in form and that S5,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">though true, isn’t formally so.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Given that formal truth is parasitic on informal truth, the reason being that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">instances of formal truths are instances of informal ones, entailment cannot</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">ultimately, or even proximately, be understood in formal terms and, in</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">addition, only a fraction of the inferences that we make are formal. (This is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">setting aside the fact noted a moment ago that so-called formal reasoning is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">really informal reasoning in disguise.)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-3-7-0">3.7 Entailment not a limiting case of confirmation</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">For P to entail Q is not for P to confirm Q to the highest possible</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">degree.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Entailment is a logical notion. Confirmation is an explanatory notion.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">For P to confirm Q to be a high degree is for (P and not-Q) to be</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">counter-explanatory. In other words, it is for (P and not-Q) to be false unless</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">deeply rooted presumptions about how the world works are uprooted and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">replaced.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">For P to entail Q is for (P and not-Q) to be counter-conceptual. In other</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">words, it is for the structures of concepts, unassisted by presumptions on our</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">part as to how the world works, to prohibit the falsity of Q, given the truth of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">P.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Therefore, P’s confirming Q to the highest possible degree is different</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">from P’s entailing Q.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-3-8-0">3.8 Entailment both an intersentential and an interpropositional relation</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Sometimes the word “entailment” refers to a relationship that holds between</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">propositions (sentence-meanings), and sometimes it refers to a relation that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">holds between expressions of some kind. Some logicians hold that those</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">expressions are sentence-types. Others, myself included, hold that those</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">relations may hold between sentence-types and also between sentence-</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">tokens. (Peter Strawson (1950) was the first to distinguish token-entailment</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">from type-entailment. In so doing, he performed a major service for</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">philosophy.)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">With rare exceptions (Strawson being one of them), authors who discuss</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">“entailment” don’t make it clear whether they are talking about a relationship</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">that holds between propositions, sentences, or neither.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Because this is an introductory text, we are leaving it open whether</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">entailment refers to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(i) an intersentential relation,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(ii) an interpropositional relation,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(iii) both,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(iv) some third notion, or</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(v) all of the above</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The answer is (v). We will now outline the reasons for this. (These reasons</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">are discussed in detail in Intermediate Set-theory and Logic.)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-3-8-1-0">3.8.1 Four kinds of logical equivalence</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">There are four kinds of logical equivalence:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(i) The kind that holds between propositions,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(ii) The kind that holds between sentence-tokens, and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(iii) The kind that holds between sentence-types.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(iv) The kind that holds between predicates.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The following two propositions are equivalent:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(1) Jim has 2 cars.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(1*) If n is the number of Jim’s cars, n+1=3.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(1) cannot be true unless (1*) is true, and (1*) cannot be true unless (1) is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">true. In general, two propositions P and Q are equivalent iff the one cannot be</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">true unless the other is true.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">To say of two sentence-tokens, S and S*, that they are ‘equivalent’ is to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">say that, if P and P* are the propositions meant by S and S*, respectively, P is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">equivalent with P*. Thus, if S is an utterance of “Jim has 2 cars” and S* is an</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">utterance, in the very same context, of “if n is the number of Jim’s cars,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">n+1=3”, then, given that the propositions borne by S and S*are (1) and (1*),</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">respectively, it follows that what is meant by S is equivalent with what is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">meant by S*, in the sense that what is meant by S is true just in case what is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">meant by S* is true.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Sentence-types are neither true nor false. The sentence-type “I am tired”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is neither true nor false. It is particular tokens of that type that are true or</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">false. The meaning of that type is a rule to the effect that if somebody x utters</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">that sentence in a given context C, then that utterance is true exactly if, in C,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">x is tired. Thus, the meaning of the sentence-type “I am tired” is a function</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">from contexts of utterance to propositions. The same is true of any given</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">sentence-type of natural language. Any given such sentence contains a tense-</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">marker and therefore has for its meaning a function from times of utterance to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">propositions. In some cases, e.g. “2+2 equals 4”, the function in question is a</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">constant function: any two tokens of that sentence-type encode the same</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">proposition. But a function, even a constant function, from contexts of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">utterance to propositions is neither true nor false. Therefore, supposing</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">arguendo that two sentence-types, T and T*, can be ‘equivalent’, it is not in</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">the same sense as S and S*. Nor, obviously, is it in the same sense as T and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">T*.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">That said, there is a sense in which two sentence-types can be equivalent.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Let T be the sentence-type “for any n, if triangles have n-many sides, then</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">n2=9”, and let T* be the sentence-type “for any n, no triangle has n-many</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">sides unless n+1=4.” There is a sense in which T and T* are ‘equivalent.’</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">They are equivalent in the sense that, the semantic rules of English semantic</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">being what they are, no token of T can bear a proposition that is non-</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">equivalent with any token of T*. So, if p1…pn are the semantic rules of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">English, then to say of T and T* that they are equivalent is to say: A</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">consequence of p1…pn is that no proposition thereby assigned T is non-</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">equivalent with any proposition thereby assigned to T*.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The fourth kind of equivalence is predicate-equivalence. Consider the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">following two predicates:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(a) “x is tall,”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(b) “Either x is tall or x is a square circle.”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Since “x” is a variable, neither (a) nor (b) is either true or false. But (a) and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(b) are equivalent, in the sense that the one is true for the same values of “x”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">as the other.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Technically, a distinction is to be made between predicate-type</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">equivalence and predicate-token equivalence. And a distinction is to be made</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">between each of those two kinds of equivalence and propositional-schema</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">equivalence, a propositional-schema being what is meant by a predicate (or,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">strictly speaking, predicate-token).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-3-9-0">3.9 The irrelevance of formal logic to thought</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">For reasons that were discussed in Chapters 1, 7, and 18 of Analytic</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Philosophy, any assistance that knowledge of formal logic can provide one in</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">the way of acquiring knowledge is parasitic on one’s knowledge of informal</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">analytic truths. This has nothing to do with the idiosyncrasies of human</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">psychology. It’s an epistemological consequence of a strictly logical point.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Given any open-sentence (or open-proposition) all of whose instances are</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">true, for example:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(1) ‹(P and (P→Q))→Q›,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">the fact that it’s true for all its instances is a consequence of the fact that some</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">informal truth holds—for example:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(2) given any two propositions P and Q, ‹(P and (P→Q))→Q›).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">It must be stressed that (2) is an informal truth. (2) has the same form as</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">the false statement that:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(2#) given no two propositions P and Q, ‹(P and (P→Q))→Q›).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Nothing that has the same form as a false statement is formally true.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Therefore, (2), though true, isn’t formally so. (2#) is a statement about a class</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of formal truths; but, like most statements about formal truths, it is not itself a</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">formal truth.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Bearing this in mind, consider the following statement, which, unlike (2),</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is formally true:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(3) “if snow is white, and (if snow is white then snow is not pink), then</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">snow is not pink).”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">There are two different reasons why one might accept (3). One is that one</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">knows it to be an instance of (1) and one accepts it for that reason. But in that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">case, one is accepting (3) on the grounds that it’s a consequence of (2). Since</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(2) is informal, one’s acceptance of (3), under those circumstances embodies</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">knowledge of an informal truth.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The same thing holds if one’s acceptance of (3) is based on one’s</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">understanding of the concepts meant by the expressions composing it.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Suppose that your reason for accepting (3) is that, given your understanding</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of the concept expressed by “if...then...,” you know that it would be absurd to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">deny (3). In that case, your acceptance of (3) is based on your knowledge</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">that, the structure of that concept being what it is, any proposition of that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">form must be true. Thus, your acceptance of (3) is based on your acceptance</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of (2). Given that (2) is an informal truth, your acceptance of (3) under those</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">circumstances constitutes informal knowledge. There is no circumstance,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">therefore, under which your knowledge of (3) is any sense formal. The</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">concept of “formal” (or “mechanical”) thought is therefore an incoherent one.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-4-0-0">4.0 Models</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">An open-sentence is an expression that contains a free variable, and is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">therefore neither true nor false, but is otherwise just like a sentence. So ‹x is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">an even number› is an open-sentence, since it contains a variable (“x”) where</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">there should be a “2” or a “4” or some such. It often happens that, given a set</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of one or more open-sentences, we wish to find some way of replacing the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">variables with constants that yield true sentences. For example, let S1 be the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">set containing the following two open-sentences (I’ll henceforth omit the use</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of quasi-quotation marks):</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(1)  x is an even number that is greater than zero.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(2)  x is less than 20.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If we assign the number two or the number four to x, the result is that both</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">sentences are true. So each of these assignments validates S1.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">In general, given a set of open-sentences, an assignment of constants to the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">free variables validates that set iff two conditions are met. First, that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">assignment turns each open-sentence in that set into an actual sentence.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Second, every sentence is true.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">An assignment of constants to a set of open-sentences is an interpretation</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of that set. An interpretation of such a set validates it iff, under that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">interpretation, every sentence in that set comes out true.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Let S2 be the set containing only the following open</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">sentences:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(1) x is an odd number.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(2) x2 is greater than 80.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(3) root-x is irrational.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If we assign the number nine to x, (1) and (2) come out true; but (3) does</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">not. But if we assign the number 13 to x, (1)–(3) all come out true. (It is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">assumed that the universe of discourse is the set of numbers. This assumption</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">will continue to be made until further notice.)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">An assignment of constants to such a set of open-sentences is an</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">interpretation of that set. Not all such sets are validated by all interpretations</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of them, as we just saw.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">False interpretations must be distinguished from partial interpretations. A</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">partial interpretation is one that is incomplete but is correct as far as it goes.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Let S3 be the set containing only the following open-sentences:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(1) x is a phi.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(2) x is larger than y.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(3) y is a phi.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(4) y is a psi.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If we assign the numbers 10 and 8 is to x and y respectively, and the property</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of being even to “phi,” we’ve partially interpreted S3, since, under that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">interpretation, (1)–(3) come out true. But since we haven’t yet assigned a</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">meaning to “psi,” we haven’t completely interpreted it. We have completely</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">interpreted that set of open sentences if we make the further stipulation that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">for a thing to be a psi is for it to have the property of being less than 9. In</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">fact, supposing that we make that additional stipulation, we have provided a</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">complete interpretation of them that validates them. If we had instead</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">stipulated that for a thing to be a psi is for it to be less than 5, we would have</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">provided a complete interpretation of those open sentences that failed to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">validate them.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Oftentimes, the interpretations that are of interest are very abstract ones.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Let S4 be the set containing just the following open-sentences:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(1) x is a phi.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(2) x bears R to y.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(3) y is a psi.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(3) R is “reflexive” (any given thing bears R to itself).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(4) y bears R to z.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(5) z is a phi.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(6) R is “transitive” (if a bears it to b, and b bears it to c, then a bears it to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">c).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Here’s an interpretation of S4. x, y, and z are, respectively, the numbers two,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">three, and four. Phi and psi, respectively, are the properties of being even and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">odd. R is the less relation of being less than or equal to. y is the number.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Question: Does the following set (S5) have an</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">interpretation that validates it? If so, what is it?</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(1) x is a phi.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(2) x bears R to y.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(3) Anything that bears R to anything bears R to itself.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(4) y bears R to z.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(5) Nothing bears R to anything that has phi.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Some sets of open-sentences are true under all interpretations of them. An</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">example is the set containing: “x is identical with x” and “if, for some phi, x</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">has phi and y does not have phi, then x is not identical with y.” Others (e.g.,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">any set containing “x is not identical with x”) are true under none.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Any interpretation of a set of the first kind is a formal truth. Thus “JMK is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">identical with JMK, and anything identical with a professor is identical to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">nothing that isn’t a professor” is a formal truth.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-5-0-0">5.0 Proof that all knowledge is inferential</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The objects of knowledge are truths (e.g. 2+2=4), not things (stable-</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">patterns of mass-energy displacements, e.g. rocks, trees, stars). One is aware</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of things; one does not in the relevant sense know them. (In Spanish, German,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">and French, there is one word for truth-knowledge (saber, wissen, savoir) and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">a different one for thing-knowledge (conocer, kennen, connaître). It is truths,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">and truths alone, that one knows.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">We obviously acquire a great deal of knowledge on the basis of sensory</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">observation. But because it is states of affairs (these being compendia of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">things: rocks, trees, and the like), not truths, that are the objects of sensory</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">observation, the contents of our observations must be converted into</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">propositions if those observations are to avail us of knowledge, as opposed to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">mere awareness.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The conversion of non-propositional (observational, objectual) content into</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">propositional content involves knowledge of relations R1…Rn between non-</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">propositional data-sets, on the one hand, and propositions, on the other,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">whereby, given such and such data-sets, R1…Rn warrant the acceptance of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">thus and such propositions. R1…Rn cannot possibly be given by empirical</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">propositions (propositions known on the basis of sense-perception), since it is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">only if we first know R1…Rn that observation can avail us of any knowledge.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Therefore,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(i) R1…Rn are analytic truths, and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(ii) Our knowledge of R1…Rn is a priori, meaning that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">said knowledge is constitutive of our ability to acquire</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">knowledge.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Thus, Kant’s contention that we have a priori knowledge is correct, and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Leibniz’s contention that there are analytic truths is also correct.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-5-1-0">5.1 Proof that some truths are non-empirical</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">A truth is non-empirical if it cannot be known on the basis of sensory</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">observation. A proposition is “analytic” if its own structure guarantees its</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">truth. All non-empirical truths are analytic and vice versa.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Proof that not all truths are empirical and that not all knowledge is strictly</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">observation-based: The proposition that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(1) All truth is empirical truth</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is true exactly if</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(2) The class K of non-empirical truths is empty.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(2) cannot be known to be true on empirical grounds, since it concerns the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">scope of what cannot be known on such grounds. So (1) is not true unless it is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">a non-empirical truth. And if (1) it is non-empirical truth, then (1) is false.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Therefore, it is false.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">It follows that there are analytic truths (e.g. the negation of 1), and also</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">that we have knowledge of analytic truths (e.g. our knowledge of the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">negation of 1).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-6-0-0">6.0 Set-theoretic characterizations of truth, meaning, and entailment</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Truths are true propositions. A proposition is a class of properties. More</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">precisely, a given proposition P is the smallest class of properties p1…pn such</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(i) P is true exactly if p1…pn are jointly instantiated and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(ii) It must be assumed that p1…pn are P’s constituents, lest P’s inferential</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">properties be inexplicable.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Let P be the proposition Sam is smart. P is true exactly if the following</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">properties are instantiated:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">p1: The property of being identical with Sam.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">p2: The property of being smart.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">p3: The property of being a thing x such that x=Sam and x is smart.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Of course, P is true exactly p3 by itself is instantiated. (This is consistent</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">with our analysis, since, if p3 instantiated, so are p1 and p2. ) But p1 and p2</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">must be reckoned as being among the constituents of P. This is because P’s</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">composition must parallel that of the sentence “Sam is tall.” For P is by</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">definition the meaning of (that which is expressed by) the sentence “Sam is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">tall” (henceforth “S”); and S’s constituents (setting aside the tense-marker,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">which is not important in this context) are</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(1) “Sam”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(2) “is tall” (or, more accurately, “x is tall”---the “x”,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">though typically orthographically suppressed, always</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">being semantically present), and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(3) “Sam is tall.”</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If it is assumed that P’s composition parallels S’s, then P must be assumed</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">to be a set whose members p1,  p2, and p3. And unless P’s composition is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">assumed to parallel S’s, it is impossible to explain P’s inferential properties.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">For example, when it is said, as it sometimes is, that the proposition (not the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">sentence)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(P2) something is smart</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is a formal consequence of P, this can be taken to mean that:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(P3) Being a member of P, p2 cannot be instantiated unless P is true.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">In general, cases of formal entailment among propositions can be</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">identified with cases of set-membership. (Formal entailment among sentences</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is an entirely different matter.) Given two propositions p and q, p formally</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">entails q if q is a member or the property-class with which p is identical.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">p informally entails q if</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(a) q is not a member of p, but</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(b) There is some property class Q such that q is a</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">member of Q and, moreover, the members of Q are</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">jointly instantiated just in case the members of p are</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">jointly instantiated.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">For example,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(P4) Sam is both sentient (aware, but not necessarily</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">truth-aware) and sapient (truth-aware, as opposed to</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">object-aware)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is an informal consequence of P. x is sentient is not a constituent of P. But x</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is sentient is a constituent of many a proposition Q that is equivalent with P,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">e.g.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(P5) Sam is sentient, sapient, and, relative to other</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">sapient creatures, exceptionally adept at processing</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">information.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Not only is P5 a consequence of P; P is a consequence of P5. They are</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">equivalent, since each is an informal consequence of the other.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">In general, if P then Q is necessarily true if the members of P cannot be</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">jointly instantiated unless the members of Q are jointly instantiated, and it is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">formally true if the members of Q are subset of the members of P.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The sequel to the present volume contains an analysis of molecular</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">propositions (propositions that are either quantified generalizations or that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">contain other propositions as proper parts), which, though a natural extension</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of the just-stated analysis, is not an obvious such extension. The sequel also</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">contains rigorous and general analyses of function, recursion, number, formal</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">language, continuity, and dimensionality. We will now put forth rough and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">ready analyses of these concepts, it being the purpose of the sequel to this</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">text to justify as well as refine these analyses.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-7-0-0">7.0 Outline of the contents of the sequel to this volume</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-7-1-0">7.1 Function</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">A function is a rule that assigns no more than one output to any given</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">input. A function therefore generates, and may therefore be identified with, a</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">class K of ordered pairs such that if (x,y) and (x,z) both belong to K, then</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">y=z.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">A function of more than one variable can be represented as a function</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">one variable, where that variable is an ordered n-tuple. Thus, the addition</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">function can be regarded as a function of two variables (e.g. one that assigns</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">7 to 3 when the value of the other independent variable is 4) or as a function</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of one variable (one that assigns 7 to (3,4)).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-7-2-0">7.2 Recursive definition</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">A recursive definition is one to the effect that some class K is the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">posterity of α with respect to R, for some α and some ordering relation R.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">R is an ordering relation if R with respect to K if, for any members x, y,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">and z of K, ¬xRx (x doesn’t bear R to itself: R is non-reflexive), asymmetric</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(xRy→¬yRx) (y doesn’t bear R to x if x bears R to x: R is asymmetric) and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(xRy→(yRz→xRz) (x bears to whenever y bears R to z and x bears R to y: R</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is transitive).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">K is the posterity of α with respect to R if K is the smallest class such</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(i) α ∈K, and</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(ii) δ ∈K whenever βRδ,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">where β ∈K.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-7-3-0">7.3 Cardinals, rationals, and reals</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">A cardinal number is the size of a class. The meaning of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(a) Jim has 3 houses</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(b) K has 3 members,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">where K is the class of Jim’s houses.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The class ℕof cardinal numbers is defined inductively: x belongs to ℕ</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">iff either</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(A) x=0 or</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(B) x=n+1,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">where n ∈ℕ.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Given a class K, K has 0 members if, for all x, x ∉K; and K has n+1</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">members if, for some y such that y ∈K, any class K* has n members if</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">y ∉K* but K* otherwise has the same members as K.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">ℚcan be recursively defined, where ℚis the class of rationals, since the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">members of ℚ are the members of the posterity of k2 with respect to ρ, where</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">kn is the class of all rationals (with denominator n>0) having index n,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">meaning that kn={p/q: p+q=n} (e.g. k5={1/4,4/1,2/3,3/2}, and where ρ is the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">relation borne by km to km+1, for arbitrary m.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Equivalently, ℚ is the smallest class whose members occurring on the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">following series:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">1/1, ½, 2/1, 1/3, 3/1, 2/2, ¼, 4/1, 2/3, 3/2,…</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The reals cannot be recursively defined since, given any list L of real</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">numbers (represented as repeating decimals), D(L) ∉L, where D(L) is the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">number that results when, if x is the figure n the nth decimal place of the nth</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">member of L, x is replaced with x+1 when x<9 and x is replaced with 0 when</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">x=9.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">ℝ is the class that contains every rational, along with every number that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">is the limit of an initial segment of ( ℚ,<), where ( ℚ,<) is the series rationals</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">arranged from lesser to greater. An initial segment of ( ℚ,<) is one that</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">doesn’t contain a given rational unless it contains every smaller rational.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-7-4-0">7.4 Formal languages</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">A formal language is a recursively defined expression-class.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If K is a class of truths, K can be formalized if there is some formal</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">language L such that, for some t, t ∈K whenever s ∈L, where t is the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">meaning of s.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Therefore, a class K of truths can be formalized exactly if K can be</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">recursively defined.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-7-5-0">7.5 Incompleteness</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Any given recursive definition generates a discrete series (a series each</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of whose members has an immediate successor). If S and S* are any two</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">discrete series, S and S* are isomorphic, meaning that any truth concerning</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">the relation of any S-member x to any S-member y is equivalent to some</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">truth about some S*-member x* to some S*-member y*.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Any given discrete series is isomorphic with ( ℕ,<), this being the</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">series: 0,1,2,3,…</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Therefore, any given recursive definition, and therefore any</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">uninterpreted calculus (any formal language), is modeled by a structure that is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">structure-identical with ℕ.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">This means that ( ℕ,<) is a model of any formal language L of which</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">( ℝ,<) is also a model.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">This means that there is no way to formalize arithmetic, since ( ℝ,<) is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">described by a subset of the class of arithmetical truths.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">This means that any consistent model of arithmetic is incomplete.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-7-6-0">7.6 Axiom-sets in relation to incompleteness</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">An axiom-set is a finite class of sentence-schema. A sentence-schema</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(plural: schemata) is an expression that contains a free variable, and is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">therefore neither true nor false, but is otherwise just like a sentence. x is tall is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">a sentence-schema. Other examples of sentence-schemata are: x has ��, x</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">bears R to y, and P or not-P.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">An axiom is a member of an axiom-set.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">An axiom is neither true nor false, since an axiom is a sentence-schema</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">and sentence-schemata are neither true nor false.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Given a class K of sentence-schemata, K* is a model of K if, for any</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">member s* of K*, there is some member s of K such that s* is the result of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">coupling s with a specific meaning.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">A class K* of truths can be formalized if, and only if, K* is the model</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of a class K sentence-schemata all of whose models are isomorphic with each</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">other. If, for any class K of sentence-schemata modelled by a class K* of</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">truths, there are non-isomorphic models, then K* cannot be formalized. If, for</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">some such class K, any models of K are isomorphic, then K* can be</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">formalized.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If K ℝmodels a recursively defined class K of sentence-schemata, where</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">K ℝcontains the arithmetic of real numbers, K ℕalso models K, where</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">K ℕcontains the arithmetic of cardinals but not of reals. There is no one-one</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">correspondence between K ℝ, and K ℕ. Therefore, K ℕ is not isomorphic with</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">K ℝ. Therefore, K ℝ cannot be formalized.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-7-7-0">7.7 Compactness vs. continuity</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">A series S is compact if it is not discrete. ( ℚ,<) is compact. S is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">continuous if it contains each of its own limiting points. ( ℝ,<) is continuous.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">( ℚ,<) is not continuous.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Continuous series are always compact, but compact series are not</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">always continuous.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-7-8-0">7.8 Set-measure</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The measure of a class K is minimal if K has n-many members, for</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">some n≤ℵ0, where ℵ0-many is the number of members of any class that can</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">be recursively defined.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The measure of a class is nil if K has no members.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The measure of a non-empty class is non-minimal if K has ℵ1-many</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">members, where ℵ1 is the number of members of ℝ.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The values of direct measurements are always given by rational</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">numbers. But given two direct measurements whose values are m1 and m2, it</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">may follow that m3 is irrational. For example, the length of  m3 = √2 units</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">when m3 the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle  each of whose other</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">sides have been shown through direct measurement to have a length of one</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">unit.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">If M1 and M2 are the numbers corresponding any two distinct lengths</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(or velocities or masses or volumes…), there are infinitely many irrational</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">numbers M3 in between M1 and M2. Therefore, if φ is any degree property</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(e.g. length, mass, volume), the degree to which x has φ cannot change at all</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">without assuming infinitely many irrational values. It follows that the number</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of any class K that does not contain irrationals is too small to be the measure</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">of any magnitude that is had to any degree other than an infinitesimally small</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">one, this being why a class whose cardinality is n, where 0≤n≤ℵ0, is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">minimal (but not nil).</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Equivalently, measurement is neither identical nor identifiable with</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">enumeration. To enumerate a class is to assign each of its members an</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">integer, on the condition no two members are assigned the same integer.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Since [ ℚ]=[ ℕ], where [k] is k’s cardinality, ℚis as measurement-useless</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">as ℕ. And since [ ℝ] is by definition the number of the smallest non-</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">measurement-useless class, it follows that the values of direct and indirect</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">measurement are always real numbers.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-7-9-0">7.9 Nil vs. infinitesimal</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Real numbers are degrees. Cardinals are class-sizes. Rationals are</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">relations between class sizes. (m/n is the relation that x bears to y when</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">x×n=y×m.)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Given an event e, when it is said that p(e)=0, where p(e) is the</p>

<p class="document-paragraph">(A) e’s probability is nil or</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">(B) e’s probability is minimal but not nil.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Given some quarter C and some surface S larger than C on which C is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">being dropped, there are ℵ1-many regions on S that C can occupy. Therefore,</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">the probability that C will occupy this or that specific region is less than any</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">positive amount, since 1/ ℵ1 is less than any positive rational. But there is</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">some region R such that C does occupy.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">p(e) is minimal but not nil, where e is C’s occupying R, for some</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">specific region R. Equivalently, 0C≠OR, where 0C  is cardinal 0 and 0R is real</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">0.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">A magnitude is 0R if that magnitude’s degree is 0. If D is a given</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">magnitude’s degree, D is 0 if D≤ℵ0. Probabilities are given by degrees, like</p>
