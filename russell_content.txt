<p class="document-paragraph">A Note on Notation</p>

Russell's notation are explicitly noted.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-1-0-0">Chapter 1: The Incompleteness of Dedekind's Axiom-set</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Introduction 
The foundations of arithmetic rest upon our ability to characterize the natural 
numbers through a set of axioms. Dedekind's attempt to do so, while 
groundbreaking, reveals fundamental issues about the nature of mathematical 
definition. This chapter examines why Dedekind's axioms, though accurate, fail to 
uniquely characterize the natural numbers.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-1-1-0">1. Dedekind's Axioms 
The axiom set consists of five fundamental statements:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-1-2-0">1. 0 is a number 
2. The successor of a number is a number 
3. No two numbers have the same successor 
4. 0 is not the successor of any number 
5. If 0 has a property, and n+1 has that property whenever n has it, then every (finite 
number) has that property</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Key Definitions 
- The intended domain: The class K of whole numbers 
- The intended truths: The class K* of arithmetic truths expressible using: 
 * 0 
 * successor 
 * addition (+) 
 * multiplication (×) 
 * existential quantification 
 * negation</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-1-3-0">2. The Problem of Unintended Models 
The axioms fail to uniquely characterize the natural numbers because they admit 
models that, while satisfying all axioms, clearly diverge from our intended 
interpretation.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Model 1 
- Let "0" refer to 100 
- Let "successor of n" refer to 2n 
- Validates all axioms but generates sequence: 100, 200, 400,...</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Model 2 
- Let "0" refer to 1 
- Let "successor of n" refer to "smallest prime > n" 
- Validates all axioms but generates sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11,...</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Model 3 
- Let "0" refer to 1 
- Let "successor of n" refer to "{n}" (singleton set) 
- Validates all axioms but generates fundamentally different structure</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-1-4-0">3. The Categorical Failure 
The existence of these models demonstrates that the axioms are not categorical - 
they do not pin down a unique structure up to isomorphism.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Why This Matters 
The common objection that these models involve "misinterpretation" of terms begs 
the question. The very purpose of axiomatization is to fix the meaning of primitive 
terms through their logical relationships.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Formal Analysis 
If we represent the intended structure as M = <N, 0, S> where: 
- N is the set of natural numbers 
- 0 ∈ N 
- S: N → N is the successor function</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Then we can show that there exist structures M' = <N', 0', S'> that: 
1. Satisfy all Dedekind axioms 
2. Are not isomorphic to M 
3. Cannot be excluded by adding finitely many axioms of the same logical type</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-1-5-0">4. Implications 
This inadequacy reveals several important points about mathematical foundations:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-1-6-0">1. Informal understanding often relies on implicit assumptions not captured in 
formal systems 
2. The gap between intended and formal meaning cannot always be bridged through 
first-order axiomatization 
3. Some mathematical concepts may require higher-order logic or additional 
mathematical machinery to characterize uniquely</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Study Questions 
1. Why can't we simply add an axiom excluding the unintended models? 
2. What does this tell us about the relationship between formal and informal 
mathematics? 
3. Construct your own model that satisfies Dedekind's axioms but differs from the 
standard interpretation 
4. How might this problem relate to Gödel's incompleteness theorems?</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Exercises 
1. Prove that Model 1 satisfies each of Dedekind's axioms 
2. Find a property shared by all numbers in Model 2 that is not shared by all natural 
numbers 
3. Construct a bijection between Model 3 and the standard natural numbers 
4. Show that no finite set can satisfy Dedekind's axioms</p>

<p class="document-paragraph">Notes 
1. The distinction between adequate and complete characterization becomes 
crucial in modern mathematical logic 
2. This problem foreshadows deeper issues in model theory and mathematical 
foundations 
3. The resolution ultimately requires tools beyond first-order logic</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-2-0-0">Chapter 2: The Nature of Natural Numbers</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Introduction 
The quest to understand what numbers truly are leads us to a fundamental insight: 
numbers are properties of classes, not of individual objects. This chapter develops 
this crucial idea and explores its implications for mathematical foundations.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-2-1-0">1. Numbers as Properties of Classes</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The Basic Insight 
Consider two fundamental statements: 
1. "Jim has two cars" 
2. "Jim has zero cars"</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Key Observation 
Neither statement attributes properties to individual cars: 
- In (1), no specific car has the property "two" 
- In (2), there clearly exists no car having the property "zero"</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Analysis 
These statements are about classes: 
- (1) attributes a property to the class of Jim's cars 
- (2) states that a particular class (Jim's cars) is empty</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-2-2-0">2. The Quantifier Analysis</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Quantifiers and Class Properties 
- Words like "0" and "2" function as quantifiers 
- Similar to "some" and "all" in logical notation 
- Example: "Some man is tall" answers the question "How many members does the 
class of tall men have?"</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Double Interpretation 
Quantified statements can be interpreted as: 
1. Statements about classes of individuals 
2. Statements about classes of statements</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Example Analysis:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">``` 
"Some man is tall" can mean either: 
a) The class of tall men has at least one member 
b) At least one statement of form "x is a man and x is tall" is true 
```</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-2-3-0">3. Numbers as Properties of Properties</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Key Insight 
Numbers are second-order properties: 
- 0 is a property of the property "being a square circle" 
- 1 is a property of the property "being a U.S. President in 2014"</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Formal Definition 
For any number n: 
- A property has number n iff it has exactly n instances 
- A set has number n iff it has exactly n members</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-2-4-0">4. Frege's Analysis of Cardinality</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">What It Means for a Class to Have n Members 
For each n, we can define precisely what it means:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Zero Members</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">k has 0 members iff k is empty</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">One Member 
k has 1 member iff: 
- For some x, x is a member of k 
- For any y, y is a member of k iff y=x</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Two Members 
k has 2 members iff: 
- For some x and y where x≠y 
- Each of x and y is a member of k 
- For any z, z is a member of k iff z=x or z=y</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">General Pattern 
This pattern extends naturally to any finite number</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-2-5-0">5. Numbers as Classes of Equinumerous Classes</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The Concept of Equinumerosity 
Two classes are equinumerous if: 
- They can be put into one-one correspondence 
- Each member of one can be paired with exactly one member of the other</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Formal Definition</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Let Kn be the class of all n-membered classes 
- 'k has n members' ≡ 'k is a member of Kn' 
- We can identify n with Kn 
- The property of having n members ≡ membership in n</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-2-6-0">6. Alternative Analysis: Numbers as Properties</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Advantages of Property-Based Analysis 
1. Doesn't require infinitely many objects 
2. Avoids making number identity contingent on universe composition</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Example 
The number 2 as: 
a) Class-based: The class of all pairs 
b) Property-based: The property of being a two-membered class</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Study Questions 
1. Why can't numbers be properties of individual objects? 
2. How does Frege's analysis avoid circularity? 
3. What advantages does the property-based analysis have over the class-based 
analysis? 
4. Can you construct a definition for "k has 4 members" following Frege's pattern?</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Exercises 
1. Prove that equinumerosity is an equivalence relation</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-2-7-0">2. Show how the property-based analysis avoids Russell's paradox 
3. Construct explicit one-one correspondences between example equinumerous 
classes 
4. Analyze the statement "Most philosophers are logical" using the quantifier 
framework</p>

<p class="document-paragraph">Notes 
1. The distinction between numbers as classes and numbers as properties remains 
philosophically significant 
2. The analysis here provides foundations for later discussions of infinite cardinals 
3. The property-based approach anticipates modern category-theoretic 
perspectives</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-3-0-0">Chapter 3: The Definitions of "0" and "+1"</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Introduction 
The foundation of arithmetic rests on properly defining two primitive notions: zero 
and the successor operation. This chapter shows how these concepts can be 
rigorously constructed from set-theoretic principles, avoiding the circularity that 
plagues naive definitions.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-3-1-0">1. Hereditary (Inductive) Relations</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The Problem of "And So On" 
Traditional definition: "The natural numbers are 0, 1, 2, and so on." 
- This is clearly inadequate 
- "And so on" requires precise definition 
- The very concept we're trying to define seems presupposed</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The Correct Definition 
(N) The class of natural numbers is the smallest class containing 0 that is closed 
under the successor relation.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Analysis of Components 
1. "Smallest class containing 0" 
 - Establishes the starting point 
 - Ensures no unnecessary elements</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-3-2-0">2. "Closed under the successor relation" 
 - If n is in the class, n+1 must be in the class 
 - Captures the generative nature of numbers</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-3-3-0">3. "Smallest such class" 
 - Eliminates unintended elements 
 - Ensures minimality</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-3-4-0">2. Definition of Zero</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Frege's Analysis 
0 = the class of all empty classes</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Key Properties 
1. There is exactly one empty class (by Extensionality) 
2. The empty class exists necessarily 
3. This definition makes 0 independent of contingent facts</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Formal Statement 
Let Ø be the empty class 
- 0 is identical with {Ø} 
- This makes 0 the class whose sole member is the empty class</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-3-5-0">3. Definition of Successor</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Formal Definition 
For any numbers m and n: 
m is the successor of n (m = n+1) if and only if: 
- For any member s of m 
- For any member x of s 
- The set s* that does not include x but otherwise has the same membership as s is 
a member of n</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Analysis of Definition 
1. m is a class of classes (the class of all m-membered classes) 
2. n is a class of classes (the class of all n-membered classes) 
3. Any m-membered class has exactly one more member than any n-membered 
class</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-3-6-0">4. Proofs of Dedekind's Axioms</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Axiom 1: 0 is a number 
Proof: 
1. "n is a number" means "n is a class of equinumerous sets" 
2. 0 is the class of all empty sets 
3. Any two empty sets are equinumerous 
4. Therefore, 0 is a number</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Axiom 2: The successor of a number is a number 
Proof: 
1. Let n be an arbitrary number 
2. Let s be an arbitrary n-membered class 
3. Let x be an arbitrary non-member of s 
4. Let s* be a class that includes x but is otherwise like s 
5. s* is an n+1-membered class 
6. The class of all n+1 membered classes is a number 
 - Because it's a maximal class of equinumerous classes</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Axiom 3: No two numbers have the same successor 
Proof: 
1. Let n and m be distinct numbers 
2. Let s be an arbitrary n-membered class 
3. Let s* be an arbitrary m-membered class 
4. Since n ≠ m, s and s* cannot be put in one-one correspondence 
5. For any x not in s or s*: 
 - Let sx include x but otherwise coincide with s 
 - Let s*x include x but otherwise coincide with s* 
6. sx and s*x cannot be put in one-one correspondence 
7. Therefore n+1 ≠ m+1</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Axiom 4: 0 is not the successor of any number 
Proof: 
1. 0 is the empty set 
2. There are no non-empty subsets of 0 
3. Therefore, there is no subset of 0 that is better populated than any set 
4. Thus, 0 isn't the successor of any number</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-3-7-0">5. Definition by Abstraction</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Nature of the Method 
- Defines entities indirectly through equivalence relations 
- Avoids circularity while capturing essential properties</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">- Provides rigorous foundation for mathematical concepts</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Examples 
1. Length 
2. Points in time 
3. Points in space</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Study Questions 
1. Why is the "and so on" definition inadequate? 
2. How does Frege's definition of 0 avoid circularity? 
3. Why must we prove Dedekind's axioms from our definitions? 
4. What role does the Axiom of Extensionality play?</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Exercises 
1. Prove that 1 is the successor of 0 using the given definitions 
2. Show that 2 is the successor of 1 
3. Construct a formal proof that 0 has no predecessors 
4. Define 3 explicitly using the successor operation</p>

<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-4-0-0">Chapter 4: Serial Order</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Introduction 
The concept of order is fundamental to mathematics, yet its precise 
characterization requires careful analysis. This chapter examines how 
mathematical ordering can be rigorously defined and explores the distinction 
between different types of ordering relations.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-4-1-0">1. Basic Concepts</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Definition of a Series 
A series is an ordered pair <K, R> where: 
- K is a class of objects (the domain) 
- R is an ordering relation on K</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Properties of Ordering Relations 
For any x, y, and z in K, an ordering relation R must satisfy: 
1. Asymmetry: If xRy, then not(yRx) 
2. Transitivity: If xRy and yRz, then xRz 
3. Connection: If x≠y, then either xRy or yRx</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Formal Notation 
For clarity, we can write: 
``` 
Asymmetry: xRy → ¬(yRx) 
Transitivity: (xRy ∧ yRz) → xRz 
Connection: x≠y → (xRy ∨ yRx) 
```</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-4-2-0">2. Types of Ordering</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Strict Ordering 
A relation R establishes a strict ordering when: 
1. The members of K are connected under R 
2. R is asymmetrical with respect to K's members 
3. R is transitive with respect to K's members</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Example: Natural Numbers 
- K = {natural numbers} 
- R = "less than" (<) 
- Forms <K, R> = <ℕ, <></p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Partial Ordering 
A relation R establishes a partial ordering when:</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-4-3-0">1. R is asymmetrical and transitive 
2. K's members are not necessarily connected under R</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Example: Human Height 
- K = {human beings} 
- R = "is taller than" 
- Not all pairs are comparable (same height possible)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-4-4-0">3. Mathematical Examples</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The Natural Number Series 
Consider <ℕ, <> where: 
- Domain: Natural numbers 
- Relation: Less than 
- Properties: 
 * If n < m, then not(m < n) 
 * If n < m and m < p, then n < p 
 * For any n,m ∈ ℕ where n≠m, either n < m or m < n</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">The Rational Number Series 
Consider <ℚ, <> where: 
- Domain: Rational numbers 
- Relation: Less than 
- Notable feature: Dense ordering (between any two elements exists another)</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-4-5-0">4. Formal Properties</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Important Distinctions 
1. Strict vs. Non-strict Ordering 
 - Strict: x < y 
 - Non-strict: x ≤ y</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-4-6-0">2. Total vs. Partial Ordering 
 - Total: All elements comparable 
 - Partial: Some elements may be incomparable</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Additional Properties 
1. Density 
 - For any x,y where xRy, exists z where xRz and zRy 
 - Example: Rationals are dense</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-4-7-0">2. Completeness 
 - Every bounded set has a least upper bound 
 - Example: Reals are complete, rationals are not</p>

<p class="document-paragraph">Introduction 
The Axiom of Choice (AC) and the Law of Excluded Middle (LEM) are fundamental 
principles whose relationship reveals deep connections between set theory and 
logic. This chapter examines their nature, justification, and implications.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-8-1-0">1. The Axiom of Choice</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Basic Formulation 
For any class K of non-empty sets: 
- There exists a selection function f 
- Such that f(S) ∈ S for each S ∈ K</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Different Cases</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Finite Cases 
1. Finite collection, finite sets: 
 - Selection obviously possible 
 - Can be explicitly constructed</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-8-2-0">2. Finite collection, infinite sets: 
 - Selection still clearly possible 
 - May not be explicitly definable</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Infinite Cases 
1. Infinite collection, finite sets: 
 - Selection possible but may not be constructible 
 - Requires careful analysis</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-8-3-0">2. Infinite collection, infinite sets: 
 - Most controversial case 
 - Core of AC debate</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-8-4-0">2. Non-Constructive Proofs</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Classic Example: Irrational Powers 
Theorem: There exist irrationals a,b such that aᵇ is rational</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Proof: 
1. Consider √2^√2 
2. If rational, done (with a=b=√2) 
3. If irrational, take: 
 - a = √2^√2 
 - b = √2 
4. Then aᵇ = (√2^√2)^√2 = √2^2 = 2</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Analysis of Proof 
1. Doesn't construct specific numbers</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-8-5-0">2. Uses LEM

- Either P is true or P is false 
- No third possibility exists</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Constructivist Critique 
1. Mathematical objects are mind-dependent 
2. Truth requires constructibility 
3. Some propositions neither true nor false</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Defense of LEM

<p class="document-paragraph">Introduction 
Propositional functions form the bridge between logic and mathematics, enabling 
us to understand quantification, existence claims, and the nature of mathematical 
truth. This chapter examines their structure and significance.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-11-1-0">1. Basic Concepts</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Definition 
A propositional function is: 
- The meaning of an open sentence 
- Maps individuals to truth values 
- Example: "x is tall" maps each individual to T/F</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Structure 
1. Components: 
 - Variable(s) 
 - Predicate 
 - Logical operators</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-11-2-0">2. Formal Notation: 
 ``` 
 φ(x): propositional function 
 φ(a): proposition (when 'a' substituted for x) 
 ```</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-11-3-0">2. Quantified Generalizations</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Formation 
1. Starting point: propositional function</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-11-4-0">2. Bind variables with quantifiers 
3. Result: complete proposition</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Example Analysis 
"Five men are tall" means: 
``` 
∃x₁,x₂,x₃,x₄,x₅( 
 Man(x₁) ∧ Tall(x₁) ∧ 
 Man(x₂) ∧ Tall(x₂) ∧ 
 ... 
 ∧ x₁≠x₂ ∧ x₁≠x₃ ∧ ... 
) 
```</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-11-5-0">3. Properties of Quantified Statements</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Class-Level Properties 
1. About classes, not individuals 
2. Example: "For some x, x is tall" 
 - Not about any specific tall thing 
 - About class of tall things</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Modal Properties 
1. Different from individual statements</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-11-6-0">2. Example: 
 - "Smith is tall" contingent 
 - "Something is tall" different modal status</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-11-7-0">4. Temporal Quantifiers</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Analysis of "Always" 
1. "Jim always smokes" means: 
 ``` 
 ∀t(Jim-smokes-at(t)) 
 ``` 
2. Property of class of propositions 
3. Subset relation to true propositions</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">General Form 
"A is always B" means: 
``` 
∀x(A(x) → B(x)) 
``` 
- Class relationship 
- Not about individuals</p>

<p class="document-paragraph">Properties of Existence 
1. Property of propositional functions 
2. Intersection with true propositions 
3. Not property of individuals</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-11-9-0">6. Role in Reasoning</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Four Basic Operations 
1. Positing existence 
2. Denying existence 
3. Attributing truth 
4. Attributing falsity</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Relationship 
1. Truth attribution = existence positing 
2. Falsity attribution = existence denial</p>

<p class="document-paragraph">Formal Structure 
For proposition P: 
``` 
To affirm P = assert existence of fact making P true 
To deny P = assert non-existence of such fact

<p class="document-paragraph">Examples 
1. "A is on top of B":

<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-12-1-0">Introduction</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">While Russell claimed classes don't exist and are merely convenient fictions, this 
chapter demonstrates why this view is inadequate and offers a more nuanced 
understanding of the nature of classes.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-12-2-0">1. Russell's Position</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Core Claim 
1. Classes don't exist 
2. They are convenient fictions 
3. Can be eliminated from rigorous discourse</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Russell's Argument 
1. A class of three objects isn't their conglomeration 
2. Therefore, it isn't spatiotemporal 
3. Therefore (Russell claims), it isn't anything</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Initial Assessment

<p class="document-paragraph">Introduction 
Russell's Theory of Descriptions addresses the logic and meaning of definite 
descriptions ("the φ"). While influential, the theory requires careful examination and 
reveals both insights and limitations.</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-13-1-0">1. Russell's Theory of Descriptions</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">Core Propositions 
1. "The φ is ψ" means:

 - Anything that has φ also has ψ</p>
<p class="document-paragraph">```

 ```</p>
<p class="document-paragraph font-bold text-lg mb-4" id="section-13-2-0">2. "The φ exists" means:
